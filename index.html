    <h1>  Colonial Missionary Schooling </h1>

    <h2> <strong> Start Here </strong> </h2>

    <h3> <i>Step 1: </i> Explore what it might be like to be a student attending a colonial missionary school: </h3>


    <p> What is taught and learned? What is valued? </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Examples of assignments </li>
      <li> Take quiz: What grade would you get in colonial missionary school? </li>
      <li> Choose your own adventure game </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> <i>Step 2: </i> Read <a href="bibliography.html"> annotated bibliography about the historical context: </a></h3>
      <p> The primary sources from One More Voice inspired the interactive activities in Step 1
      showing what it might be like to be a student attending a colonial missionary school.
      One More Voice is
        “a digital humanities recovery project that identifies, documents,
        and critically engages with the voices of racialized creators in
        British imperial and colonial archives.”
       The critical works provide a lens for the primary sources. </p>

  <h2> <strong> Why did we do this? </strong> </h2>

    <p> Colonial views still impact students' experiences in school today, beyond the specific communities explored on this site.
      To decolonize education, a useful place to begin is by learning about the historical context. </p>

  <h2> <strong> What next? </strong> </h2>

  <h3> <i> Step 3: </i> Learn more about decolonizing education. </h3>

  <h2> About this Project </h2>

  <p> <b>What: </b> This project explores how European religious missionaries
    shaped education in colonized communities in Africa and Asia,
    drawing from primary texts
    such as missionaries’ reports, students’ schoolwork, and interviews.
    While exploring this site, consider: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the purposes of education, and who decides?</li>
    <li>What kinds of knowledge are valued or devalued, and by whom?</li>
    <li>How does literacy empower or control?</li>
    <li>How do colonial views of gender and morality impact education?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
