      <p> “‘The Late Mr. James Cameron of Madagascar’ (Excerpt)” is a funeral
        speech given by the Queen of Madagascar at the funeral of missionary
        James Cameron, which was then transcribed, translated, and published by

        Cameron’s teaching of 600 men, setting up of a printing press to

  geographical descriptions, observations about native folks’ housing, work,
  religion, monarchy, and languages before a section focused on
  “Missionary Operations in The Niger Territory.” The “Missionary Operations”

<p>
Sechuana Proverbs collects Sechuana proverbs and aphorisms so that they are not
forgotten amid European influence in South Africa and places them alongside
English equivalents. Plaatje acknowledges the missionary Robert Moffat’s work
in putting the Sechuana language on paper when he translated the Bible into Sechuana. Plaatje discusses how proverbs were a way for women to teach their children “purity and correctness” (7) before the influence of colonial schooling.

<h2> Critical works informing my reading of primary sources </h2>

<h3> Theme: Colonial education </h3>
<p>
  The spreading of religion was a major reason for missionaries to set up
  schools, but it also included occupational training such as farming.
  The agenda for schooling was determined by the priorities of the
  missionaries—to encourage “progress” and conversion Christianity—not those
  of the students.
</p>

<h3> Theme: Colonial views of morality </h3>
<p>
  Literacy was used to push the missionaries’ morality onto others, such as by
  teaching people to read using the Bible. Many missionary reports disparage the
  moral codes of native peoples as being inferior or condemn them as sinful,
  even though one of the critical works below asserts that the existing
  religious and moral beliefs of a community led to Christianity spreading quickly
</p>

<h3> Theme: Colonial views of Gender </h3>
<p>
  The education that men receive and women receive sometimes differs,
  which establishes and reinforces gender roles. This can be seen in primary texts
  such as “Adult Sunday-Schools Among the Nestorians” and “India. Native Female Education.”
