      <p> “‘The Late Mr. James Cameron of Madagascar’ (Excerpt)” is a funeral
        speech given by the Queen of Madagascar at the funeral of missionary
        James Cameron, which was then transcribed, translated, and published by
        a British writer as part of Cameron’s obituary. The obituary praises
        Cameron’s teaching of 600 men, setting up of a printing press to
        distribute Bible verses in Malagasy, and formation of the first
        Christian church in Madagascar. Themes: colonial education,

<p> The River Niger describes what the Reverend Bishop Crowther saw as he went

  geographical descriptions, observations about native folks’ housing, work,
  religion, monarchy, and languages before a section focused on
  “Missionary Operations in The Niger Territory.” The “Missionary Operations”

  Their European Equivalents. </i> London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd., 1916.
</b></p>

<p>
Sechuana Proverbs collects Sechuana proverbs and aphorisms so that they are not
forgotten amid European influence in South Africa and places them alongside
English equivalents. Plaatje acknowledges the missionary Robert Moffat’s work
in putting the Sechuana language on paper when he translated the Bible into Sechuana. Plaatje discusses how proverbs were a way for women to teach their children “purity and correctness” (7) before the influence of colonial schooling.

<h2> Critical works informing my reading of primary sources </h2>

<h3> Theme: Colonial education </h3>
<p>
  The spreading of religion was a major reason for missionaries to set up
  schools, but it also included occupational training such as farming.
  The agenda for schooling was determined by the priorities of the
  missionaries—to encourage “progress” and conversion Christianity—not those
  of the students.
</p>

<p><b>
  Bellenoit, Hayden J. A. “Missionary Education, Religion and Knowledge in India,
  C.1880–1915.”
  <i>Modern Asian Studies, </i> vol. 41, no. 2, 2007, pp. 369–94,
  https://doi.org/10.1017/S0026749X05002143.
</b></p>

<p>
Bellenoit argues that Christian missionaries influenced colonial India by
blurring the distinctions between “moral improvement,” civilization, and religion,
and he explores the purposes of colonial missionary schools compared to how
students perceived the European curriculum. This text also ties to the theme of
morality, and it provides a lens to read the texts of Indian students’
letters explaining their learning progress.

Kallaway, Peter. “Knowledge for the People: Understanding the Complex Heritage
of Colonial Education in South Africa.” <i> Yesterday and Today, </i> vol. 28, Dec. 2022,
pp. 44–56. DOI.org (Crossref), https://doi.org/10.17159/2223-0386/2022/n28a2.
</b></p>

<p>
  Kallaway argues that we need to understand the history of colonial education
  in South Africa in order to decolonize education today, so he explores how
  English educational practices contributed to colonial education of
  working-class people in Africa. This text is relevant to the themes/works
  because it sheds light on why missionaries designed colonial schooling the
  way they did and the later impacts.

White, Bob W. “Talk about School: Education and the Colonial Project in French
and British Africa (1860-1960).” <i>Comparative Education, </i>vol. 32, no. 1, Mar.
1996, pp. 9–26. DOI.org (Crossref), https://doi.org/10.1080/03050069628902.
</b></p>

<p>
White compares the similarities and differences between French and British
colonial education policy in Africa, which he argues is partly shaped by their
different ideas of morality. This article connects to the theme of
“colonial views of morality,” and it connects to the texts that describe
the moral codes of different communities.
</p>

<h3> Theme: Colonial views of morality </h3>
<p>
  Literacy was used to push the missionaries’ morality onto others, such as by
  teaching people to read using the Bible. Many missionary reports disparage the
  moral codes of native peoples as being inferior or condemn them as sinful,
  even though one of the critical works below asserts that the existing
  religious and moral beliefs of a community led to Christianity spreading quickly
</p>

  Matemba, Yonah H. “Continuity and Change in the Development of Moral
  Education in Botswana.” <i>Journal of Moral Education, </i>vol. 39, no. 3, Sept. 2010,
  pp. 329–43. DOI.org (Crossref), https://doi.org/10.1080/03057240.2010.497613.
</b></p>

<p>
  Matemba traces how moral education developed in Botswana from pre-colonial
  times, through missionary/colonial period, and to present day, arguing that
  Christian moral values being used “as a yardstick” during the missionary
  period influences current moral education. This article relates to the texts
  discussing missionaries’ moral ideals compared to native folks’ moral ideals.

  Nduka, Otonti. “Moral Education in the Changing Traditional Societies of
  Sub-Saharan Africa.” <i>International Review of Education / Internationale
    Zeitschrift Für Erziehungswissenschaft / Revue Internationale de
    l’Education, </i> vol. 26, no. 2, 1980, pp. 153–70. JSTOR,
    http://www.jstor.org/stable/3443951. Accessed 9 Mar. 2023.
</b></p>

<p>
  Nduka asserts that European colonization of Africa has influenced in-school
  and out-of-school moral education in African societies, but there have been
  challenges integrating European and indigenous morals; thus, successful moral
  education requires cooperation between school, home, and society. This article
  connects to the texts that describe the morals that missionaries wish to
  spread and the missionaries’ frustrations with indigenous folks’ behaviors
  that they view as “sinful.”

  and the Expansion of Christianity in Bechuanaland Protectorate, 1800 to 1900.”
  <i>Journal for the Study of Religion,</i> vol. 29, no. 2, 2016, pp. 29–55. JSTOR,
  http://www.jstor.org/stable/24902913. Accessed 9 Mar. 2023.
</b></p>

<p>
  Nkomazana and Setume argue that Batswana had existing religious traditions
  that contributed to how quickly Christianity spread there, despite missionaries
  rejecting these traditions and giving the impression that no religion existed
  before they arrived. This text provides a critical lens for reading the missionary
  reports that laud their successes in spreading Christianity.
</p>


<h3> Theme: Colonial views of Gender </h3>
<p>
  The education that men receive and women receive sometimes differs,
  which establishes and reinforces gender roles. This can be seen in primary texts
  such as “Adult Sunday-Schools Among the Nestorians” and “India. Native Female Education.”
</p>

  Bertolt, Boris. “Thinking Otherwise: Theorizing the Colonial/Modern Gender
  System in Africa.” <i>African Sociological Review, </i> vol. 22, no. 1, 2018, pp. 2–17.
</b></p>

<p>
  Bertolt shows how gender inequalities in colonial Africa continue to impact
  modern day Africa. This article extends the texts to consider how colonists’
  beliefs about gender persist long after their time there.

  no. 3, 2022, pp. 185–203, https://doi.org/10.31920/2634-3622/2022/v11n3a9.
</b></p>

<p>
  Ntshangase and Matabane argue that colonization exacerbated gender inequality
  in Africa, which contributed to Africa’s underdevelopment. This text provides
  a lens to read how colonizers discussed gender and reinforced inequality.

Prevost, Elizabeth. “Married to the Mission Field: Gender, Christianity,
and Professionalization in Britain and Colonial Africa, 1865–1914.”
<i>The Journal of British Studies, </i>vol. 47, no. 4, 2008, pp. 796–826, https://doi.org/10.1086/590171.
</b></p>

<p>
  Prevost explores the tensions between female British missionaries’ gendered
  expectations and their work, which forced them to reconsider ideas of
  female authority and vocation. The gender beliefs of British missionaries
  impacted the way they view women vs. men in indigenous communities as well
  as among themselves.
