    <h1>  Mission Statement & Acknowledgments </h1>

    <h2> Mission Statement </h2>

    <p> My interest in decolonizing education stems from my experiences
      as a high school English teacher and PhD student studying writing pedagogy.
      This project has been shaped by conversations and feedback with colleagues
      in the course ENGL 877: Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities
      at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. </p>
      <p> This project is guided by the value of honoring
        labor—in the ways we approach collaboration, strive to amplify
        marginalized voices, and critically use minimal computing
        with digital tools to develop the project. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b> Collaboration: </b> Collaboration is a core tenet of digital
            humanities, and that includes honoring the often invisible labor
            of contributors, the “shadow labor” that often includes
            emotional labor (Dombrowski). The success of
            digital humanities projects is due to the work of many folks,
            including consultants, librarians, programmers, IT and
            edtech specialists (Arnold and Tilton; Boyles),
            and conversations and feedback from colleagues. </li>
          <li> <b> Amplifying marginalized voices: </b> We hope to broaden what counts
            as worthy of being studied, make our work accessible to wider
            audiences, and make digital humanities more welcoming to
            anyone who wants to be involved. These are tied to amplifying
            marginalized voices in the texts we engage with (Neumann and Rippl)
            and those who are interested in collaborating or
            doing digital humanities work, regardless of whether
            they are affiliated with a formal digital humanities program.
            If you are interested in collaborating,
            we would love to involve you. We also hope that this project
            inspires you to create your own!</li>
          <li> <b> Using minimal computing with digital tools: </b>
            We strive to use digital tools and platforms that are as
            sustainable (Dombrowski), open access, and respectful of users’
            data as possible (Glass; Boyles). As novices in web development,
            we use principles of minimal computing to work with the
            resources we have. In documenting our process, we hope that our work
            can be continued and others can use our
            process notes as a resource (Risam and Gil; Dombrowski). </li>

        </ul>

  <h2> Acknowledgments </h2>

  <p> In addition to the critical scholarly sources that have
    guided my project development, this project would not be possible
    without the guidance, conversations, and feedback of my classmates
    and professor, Dr. Adrian Wisnicki, in ENGL 477/877: Advanced projects
    in Digitial Humanities. They've provided new ways of thinking about this
    project, technological advice, and support of the emotional labor that
    goes into this work. Every interaction in in the class has
    impacted this project in some way. Therefore, it's fitting that my classmates
    appear in this Works Cited list and the Bibliography page of my project.
    While "et al." is the norm for MLA style, I've opted to include all of my
    classmates' names in alphabetical order to celebrate their roles and support.

  <h2> About this Project </h2>

  <p> <b>What: </b> This project explores how European religious missionaries
    shaped education in colonized communities in Africa and Asia,
    drawing from primary texts
    such as missionaries’ reports, students’ schoolwork, and interviews.
    While exploring this site, consider: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the purposes of education, and who decides?</li>
    <li>What kinds of knowledge are valued or devalued, and by whom?</li>
    <li>How does literacy empower or control?</li>
    <li>How do colonial views of gender and morality impact education?</li>
  </ul>
